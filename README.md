# Literary Analysis and Pann Prediction in Nalayira Divya Prabandham 
This study provides a detailed computational analysis of the Nalayira Divya Prabandham, which combines literary criticism and machine learning-predicted Pann in the analysis of the poetic and musical features of this ancient Tamil literature. In the literary analysis stage, we employed data mining methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods in the comparison of the original pazhurams and Divyartha Deepikai translations by Kanchipuram Shri Prathivadhi Bhayankaram Annangarachariar. Utilizing automated web crawlers coupled with manual editing, we systematically organized and processed the text in order to find recurring motifs, stylistic patterns, and regularly occurring lexicon specific to each Azhwar's literary style. Tamil classical literature, including Nalayira Divya Prabandham and Thirumurai, is rich in spiritual and musical tradition. A key feature of these hymns is the use of Pann, an ancient Tamil musical mode similar to Raga. Many hymns, however, do not have known Pann labels. This project aims to predict the correct Pann for each hymn using mBERT embeddings and classification models. To handle class imbalance, the ADASYN technique was applied. Among the models tested, Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the best performance with 91% accuracy, while BiLSTM and GRU achieved 87% accuracy among deep learning models. This work supports the digital preservation and musical analysis of Tamil hymns using modern AI techniques.
